Hello dear Rockbite team.
I am sending the project made by me according to your points.
I am attaching a photo where I have shown with a specific example in the Main class that the program works exactly.
I used basic OOP tools in my program and implemented notification/observer pattern.Â 
I hope we will meet in the next round.

Example `
Warehouse 1 Inventory:
Wood: 100
Steel: 50

Warehouse 2 Inventory:
Plastic: 80

Warehouse 1 Inventory After Move:
Wood: 60
Steel: 25

Warehouse 2 Inventory After Move:
Plastic: 80
Wood: 40
Steel: 25

Warehouse 1 Inventory After Removal:
Wood: 40
Steel: 10

Warehouse 3 Inventory:
Wood: 30
Plastic: 50
